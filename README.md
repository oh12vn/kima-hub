## A Note on Native Apps

Once the core experience is solid and properly tested, a native mobile app (likely React Native) is on the roadmap. The PWA works great for most cases for now.

Thanks for your patience while I work through this.

## Features

### Your Music, Your Way

-   **Stream your library** - FLAC, MP3, AAC, OGG, and other common formats work out of the box
-   **Automatic cataloging** - Kima scans your library and enriches it with metadata from MusicBrainz and Last.fm, including ISRC codes and genre tags
-   **Audio transcoding** - Stream at original quality or transcode on-the-fly (320kbps, 192kbps, or 128kbps)
-   **Lyrics** - Displays embedded lyrics or fetches them automatically from LRCLIB. Timed lyrics get line-by-line sync during playback; untimed lyrics display as static text. Coverage is good for major artists but varies for niche or independent music\*
-   **Ultra-wide support** - Library grid scales up to 8 columns on large displays

### The Vibe System

The centerpiece of music discovery in Kima. Your entire library is analyzed by a CLAP neural network and projected into a 2D/3D space where similar-sounding tracks cluster together. The result is a living map of your music collection you can explore, search, and navigate.

**Music Map** -- the default 2D view. Every track in your library is a point on the map, colored by mood cluster. Zoom and pan to explore. Click any track to inspect it; double-click to play it immediately.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/screenshots/vibe-map.png" alt="Vibe Music Map" width="800">
</p>

**Galaxy View** -- the same data rendered as a 3D star field. Orbit, zoom, and fly through your library. Switch between Map and Galaxy with the toggle in the top-left corner.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/screenshots/vibe-galaxy.png" alt="Vibe Galaxy" width="800">
</p>

**Drift** -- pick any two tracks as start and end points and Kima plots a smooth path through the audio space between them. The resulting queue travels gradually from one sonic neighborhood to the other.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/screenshots/vibe-drift.png" alt="Vibe Drift -- Song Path" width="800">
</p>

**Blend** -- add multiple tracks and let Kima find the centroid in audio space. The result is a queue of tracks that blend all of the inputs together into something new.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/screenshots/vibe-blend.png" alt="Vibe Blend" width="800">
</p>

**Additional features:**

-   **Text search** - Type any descriptor ("loud and fast", "rainy day piano") to highlight matching tracks on the map
-   **Right-click context menu** - Vibe from any track (similar-track queue), find similar (highlight on map), or start a Drift
-   **Labels** - Toggle track/artist labels on the map
-   **Keep The Vibe Going** - From the player, activate vibe mode to continuously queue tracks that match what's playing

**Mood Mixer** -- pick a mood preset (Happy, Energetic, Chill, Focus, Party, Acoustic, Melancholy, Sad, Aggressive) to instantly generate a playlist calibrated to that sound. Moods are derived from audio analysis of your actual library, not genre tags.

-   **Spotify Import** - Paste any Spotify playlist URL to import tracks
-   **Deezer Import** - Same functionality for Deezer playlists
-   **YouTube Import** - Import from YouTube and YouTube Music playlists
-   **ISRC Matching** - Deterministic track matching via International Standard Recording Codes before falling back to fuzzy text matching
-   **Smart Preview** - See which tracks are already in your library, which albums can be downloaded, and which have no matches
-   **Selective Download** - Choose exactly which albums to add to your library
-   **Browse Deezer** - Explore Deezer's featured playlists and radio stations directly in-app

</p>

### Native Apps

-   **OpenSubsonic API** - Use any Subsonic-compatible client (Symfonium, DSub, Ultrasonic, etc.) to stream your Kima library
-   **Standard Subsonic auth** - MD5 token auth supported; enter your API token as the password -- works with Amperfy, Symfonium, DSub, and any standard Subsonic client
-   **Per-client tokens** - Generate named API tokens in Settings > Native Apps; revoke them individually when a device is lost or replaced
-   **Enrichment-aware** - Genres and artist biographies exposed to clients come from Last.fm enrichment, not just file tags
-   **Lyrics, bookmarks, and play queue** - getLyrics, bookmarks, and savePlayQueue/getPlayQueue for cross-device resume

  --name kima \
  -p 3030:3030 \
  -v /path/to/your/music:/music \
  -v kima_data:/data \
  chevron7locked/kima:latest
```

That's it! Open http://localhost:3030 and create your account.

**With GPU acceleration** (requires [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html)):

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name kima \
  --gpus all \
  -p 3030:3030 \
  -v /path/to/your/music:/music \
  -v kima_data:/data \
  chevron7locked/kima:latest
```

### What's Included

The Kima container includes everything you need:

-   **Web Interface** (port 3030)
-   **API Server** (internal)
-   **PostgreSQL Database** (internal)
-   **Redis Cache** (internal)

### Configuration Options

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name kima \
  -p 3030:3030 \
  -v /path/to/your/music:/music \
  -v kima_data:/data \
  -e SESSION_SECRET=your-secret-key \
  -e TZ=America/New_York \
  --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
  chevron7locked/kima:latest
```

| Variable         | Description            | Default        |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- | -------------- |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | Session encryption key | Auto-generated |
| `TZ`             | Timezone               | UTC            |

### Using Docker Compose

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
services:
    kima:
        image: chevron7locked/kima:latest
        container_name: kima
        ports:
            - "3030:3030"
        volumes:
            - /path/to/your/music:/music
            - kima_data:/data
        environment:
            - TZ=America/New_York
        # Required for Lidarr webhook integration on Linux
        extra_hosts:
            - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
        restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
    kima_data:
```

Then run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

**Updating with Docker Compose:**

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

**Building Docker image from source:**

Building the normal way
```bash
docker build --progress=plain -t kima:customize .
```
Building the with mounting models on external volume
```bash
docker build --build-arg COPY_MODELS=false --progress=plain -t kima:customize .
```

### Bind-mounting `/data` on Linux

Named volumes are recommended. If you bind-mount `/data`, make sure required subdirectories exist and are writable by the container service users.

```bash
mkdir -p /path/to/kima-data/postgres /path/to/kima-data/redis
```

If startup logs report a permission error, `chown` the host path to the UID/GID shown in the logs (for example, the postgres user).

---

Kima will begin scanning your music library automatically. Depending on the size of your collection, this may take a few minutes to several hours.

---

## Release Channels

Kima offers two release channels to match your stability preferences:

### 🟢 Stable (Recommended)

Production-ready releases. Updated when new stable versions are released.

```bash
docker pull chevron7locked/kima:latest
# or specific version
docker pull chevron7locked/kima:v1.7.3
```

### 🔴 Nightly (Development)

Latest development build. Built on every push to main.

⚠️ **Not recommended for production** - may be unstable or broken.

```bash
docker pull chevron7locked/kima:nightly
```

**For contributors:** See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for information on submitting pull requests and contributing to Kima.

The music library path is configured via Docker volume mount (`-v /path/to/music:/music`).

#### External Access

If you're accessing Kima from outside your local network (via reverse proxy, for example), set the API URL:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://kima-api.yourdomain.com
```

And add your domain to the allowed origins:

```env
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3030,https://kima.yourdomain.com
```

---

## Security Considerations

### Environment Variables

Kima uses several sensitive environment variables. Never commit your `.env` file.

| Variable                  | Purpose                        | Required          |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------- |
| `SESSION_SECRET`          | Session encryption (32+ chars) | Yes               |
| `SETTINGS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | Encrypts stored credentials    | Yes               |
| `SOULSEEK_USERNAME`       | Soulseek login                 | If using Soulseek |
| `SOULSEEK_PASSWORD`       | Soulseek password              | If using Soulseek |
| `LIDARR_API_KEY`          | Lidarr integration             | If using Lidarr   |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY`          | AI features                    | Optional          |
| `LASTFM_API_KEY`          | Artist recommendations         | Optional          |
| `FANART_API_KEY`          | Artist images                  | Optional          |

### Authentication & Session Security

-   **JWT tokens** - Access tokens expire after 24 hours; refresh tokens after 30 days
-   **Token refresh** - Automatic token refresh via `/api/auth/refresh` endpoint
-   **Password changes** - Changing your password invalidates all existing sessions
-   **Session cookies** - Secured with `httpOnly`, `sameSite=strict`, and `secure` (in production)
-   **Encryption validation** - Encryption key is validated on startup to prevent insecure defaults

### Webhook Security

-   **Lidarr webhooks** - Support signature verification with configurable secret
-   Configure the webhook secret in Settings → Lidarr for additional security

### Admin Dashboard Security

-   **Bull Board** - Job queue dashboard at `/admin/queues` requires authenticated admin user
-   **API Documentation** - Swagger docs at `/api-docs` require authentication in production (unless `DOCS_PUBLIC=true`)

### VPN Configuration (Optional)

If using Mullvad VPN for Soulseek:

-   Place WireGuard config in `backend/mullvad/` (gitignored)
-   Never commit VPN credentials or private keys
-   The `*.conf` and `key.txt` patterns are already in .gitignore

### Generating Secrets

```bash
# Generate a secure session secret
openssl rand -base64 32

# Generate encryption key
openssl rand -base64 32
```

### Network Security

-   Kima is designed for self-hosted LAN use
-   For external access, use a reverse proxy with HTTPS
-   Configure `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` for your domain

---

## CLAP Audio Analysis

The CLAP (Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining) service generates embeddings for audio similarity search, powering the Vibe button's track matching feature.

### Requirements

-   PostgreSQL with pgvector extension (included in `pgvector/pgvector:pg16` image)
-   2-4GB RAM per worker
-   CLAP model downloads automatically on first build (~700MB)

### Configuration

Environment variables in docker-compose.yml:

| Variable                  | Default | Description                                |
| ------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `CLAP_WORKERS`            | `2`     | Number of analysis workers (1-8)           |
| `CLAP_THREADS_PER_WORKER` | `1`     | CPU threads per worker (1-4)               |
| `CLAP_SLEEP_INTERVAL`     | `5`     | Queue poll interval in seconds             |

### Usage

The CLAP analyzer runs automatically alongside the main audio analyzer. The vibe button uses CLAP embeddings for finding similar tracks. Text-based vibe search is available at `/api/vibe/search`.

### API Endpoints

| Endpoint                       | Method | Description                                |
| ------------------------------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `/api/vibe/similar/:trackId`   | GET    | Get tracks similar to the given track      |
| `/api/vibe/search`             | POST   | Search tracks by text description          |
| `/api/vibe/status`             | GET    | Get embedding progress                     |

---

## GPU Acceleration

GPU acceleration speeds up audio analysis (mood detection, BPM extraction, vibe embeddings). It is **optional** -- everything works on CPU, just slower.

### Requirements

-   NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support
-   NVIDIA drivers installed on the host (`nvidia-smi` should work)
-   [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html) -- bridges Docker to your GPU

### Install NVIDIA Container Toolkit

The toolkit is required for any Docker container to access the GPU. Install it once:

**Fedora / Nobara / RHEL:**
```bash
curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/stable/rpm/nvidia-container-toolkit.repo | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/nvidia-container-toolkit.repo && sudo dnf install -y nvidia-container-toolkit && sudo nvidia-ctk runtime configure --runtime=docker && sudo systemctl restart docker
```

**Ubuntu / Debian:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/gpgkey | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg && curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/stable/deb/nvidia-container-toolkit.list | sed 's#deb https://#deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg] https://#g' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-container-toolkit.list && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-container-toolkit && sudo nvidia-ctk runtime configure --runtime=docker && sudo systemctl restart docker
```

### Verify Host Setup

```bash
# Check NVIDIA driver
nvidia-smi

# Check container toolkit
nvidia-container-runtime --version
```

### Enable GPU

**All-in-One container:**
```bash
docker run -d --gpus all -p 3030:3030 -v /path/to/music:/music -v kima_data:/data chevron7locked/kima:latest
```

**Docker Compose:**

Uncomment the `devices` block under `audio-analyzer` (and optionally `audio-analyzer-clap`) in `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
reservations:
    memory: 2G
    devices:
        - driver: nvidia
          count: 1
          capabilities: [gpu]
```

Then restart: `docker compose up -d`

### Verify GPU Detection

```bash
# MusiCNN analyzer
docker logs kima_audio_analyzer 2>&1 | grep -i gpu

# CLAP analyzer
docker logs kima_audio_analyzer_clap 2>&1 | grep -i gpu
```

Expected: `TensorFlow GPU detected: ...` or `CUDA available: True`

If you see `TensorFlow running on CPU`, GPU passthrough is not active.

---

## Integrations

Kima works beautifully on its own, but it becomes even more powerful when connected to other services.

### Lidarr

Connect Kima to your Lidarr instance to request and download new music directly from the app.

**What you get:**

-   Browse artists and albums you don't own
-                 Request downloads with a single click
-   Discover Weekly playlists that automatically download new recommendations
-   Automatic library sync when Lidarr finishes importing

**Setup:**

1. Go to Settings in Kima
2. Navigate to the Lidarr section
3. Enter your Lidarr URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8686`)
4. Enter your Lidarr API key (found in Lidarr under Settings > General)
5. Test the connection and save

Kima will automatically configure a webhook in Lidarr to receive notifications when new music is imported.

**Networking Note:**

The webhook requires Lidarr to be able to reach Kima. By default, Kima uses `host.docker.internal:3030` which works automatically when using the provided docker-compose files (they include `extra_hosts` to enable this on Linux).

If you're using **custom Docker networks** with static IPs, set the callback URL so Lidarr knows how to reach Kima:

```yaml
environment:
    - KIMA_CALLBACK_URL=http://YOUR_KIMA_IP:3030
```

Use the IP address that Lidarr can reach. If both containers are on the same Docker network, use Kima's container IP.

### Audiobookshelf

Connect to your Audiobookshelf instance to browse and listen to audiobooks within Kima.

**What you get:**

-   Browse your audiobook library
-   Stream audiobooks directly in Kima
-   Progress syncs between Kima and Audiobookshelf

**Setup:**

1. Go to Settings in Kima
2. Navigate to the Audiobookshelf section
3. Enter your Audiobookshelf URL (e.g., `http://localhost:13378`)
4. Enter your API key (found in Audiobookshelf under Settings > Users > your user > API Token)
5. Test the connection and save

### Soulseek

Kima includes built-in Soulseek support for finding rare tracks and one-offs that aren't available through traditional download sources like Lidarr.

[Soulseek](https://www.slsknet.org/) is a peer-to-peer file sharing network focused on music. Users share their music libraries and can browse/download from each other. Kima connects directly to the Soulseek network -- no additional software (like slskd) is required.

**Setup:**

1. Go to Settings in Kima
2. Navigate to the Soulseek section
3. Enter your Soulseek username and password (create an account at [slsknet.org](https://www.slsknet.org/) if you don't have one)
4. Save your settings

**How Search Works:**

When you search for music in Kima's Discovery tab, Soulseek results appear alongside Last.fm and Deezer results. Each result shows the filename, file size, bitrate, and format (FLAC/MP3). Metadata like artist and album is parsed from the file path structure (typically `Artist/Album/01 - Track.flac`).

**How Download Works:**

1. Click the download button on a Soulseek search result
2. Kima searches the Soulseek network for the best match (preferring FLAC, high bitrate)
3. The file is downloaded directly to your music library path
4. A library scan is triggered to import the new file
5. Metadata enrichment runs automatically (artist info, mood tags, audio analysis)

You can also configure Soulseek as a download source for playlist imports. In Settings > Downloads, set Soulseek as primary or fallback source. When importing a Spotify/Deezer playlist, tracks not found in your library will be searched and downloaded from Soulseek automatically.

**Download progress** is visible in the Activity Panel (bell icon in the top bar).

**Limitations:**

- Download speed depends on the sharing user's connection and availability
- Not all tracks will have results -- Soulseek coverage varies by genre and popularity
- Some users may have slow connections or go offline during transfers
- Kima retries with alternative users if a download fails or times out

### Native Apps (Subsonic)

Kima implements the [OpenSubsonic](https://opensubsonic.netlify.app/) REST API, making it compatible with any Subsonic client.

**Tested clients:** Amperfy (iOS), Symfonium, DSub, Ultrasonic

**Setup:**

1. Go to Settings > Native Apps in Kima
2. Enter a client name (e.g. "Amperfy on iPhone") and click **Generate Token**
3. Copy and save the token -- it is only shown once
4. In your client app, configure:
   - **Server URL** -- your Kima server address (e.g. `http://192.168.1.10:3030`)
   - **Username** -- your Kima username
   - **Password** -- the token you just generated

**Notes:**

- Standard MD5 token auth is supported -- clients that hash their password automatically will work correctly when you enter an API token as the password
- Each client should have its own token so you can revoke access per device
- Genres and biographies surfaced to clients come from Last.fm enrichment, not just file tags
- DISCOVER-location albums are excluded from all library views
- OpenSubsonic extensions exposed: `apiKeyAuthentication`, `songLyrics`, `indexBasedQueue`, and `getPodcastEpisode`
- Additional OpenSubsonic endpoints supported: `tokenInfo`, `startScan`, `getScanStatus`, `search`, `search2`, `search3`, `getUser`, `getUsers`, `createUser`, `updateUser`, `deleteUser`, `changePassword`, `getPlaylists`, `getPlaylist`, `createPlaylist`, `updatePlaylist`, `deletePlaylist`, `setRating`, `getPlayQueue`, `getPlayQueueByIndex`, `savePlayQueue`, `savePlayQueueByIndex`, `getBookmarks`, `createBookmark`, `deleteBookmark`, `getInternetRadioStations`, `createInternetRadioStation`, `updateInternetRadioStation`, `deleteInternetRadioStation`, `getAvatar`, `getShares`, `createShare`, `updateShare`, `deleteShare`, `getChatMessages`, `addChatMessage`, `getVideos`, `getVideoInfo`, `getCaptions`, `jukeboxControl`, `getTranscodeDecision`, `getTranscodeStream`, `hls`, `getLyricsBySongId`, `getLyrics`, `getNowPlaying`, `getTopSongs`, `getSongsByGenre`, `getSimilarSongs`, `getSimilarSongs2`, `getMusicDirectory`, `getPodcasts`, `getNewestPodcasts`, `getPodcastEpisode`, `refreshPodcasts`

**Subsonic route module layout (backend):**

- `backend/src/routes/subsonic/index.ts` -- top-level router composition, auth/rate-limit, system endpoints
- `library.ts` -- artists/albums/tracks browsing and directory traversal
- `search.ts` -- `search`/`search2`/`search3`, genre/top/similar discovery
- `playback.ts` -- stream/download/cover-art/scrobble/now-playing plus `hls`/`getTranscodeStream`
- `playlists.ts` -- playlist list/read/create/update/delete
- `queue.ts` -- play queue get/save (ID-based and index-based)
- `starred.ts` -- star/unstar, starred lists, `setRating`
- `artistInfo.ts` / `lyrics.ts` -- artist metadata and lyric endpoints
- `userManagement.ts` / `profile.ts` -- user admin endpoints and `getUser`
- `podcasts.ts` -- podcast subscription and episode endpoints
- `compat.ts` -- compatibility/stub endpoints for clients that expect optional APIs

**When adding a Subsonic endpoint:**

1. Add the handler in the module that matches endpoint ownership (or create a new focused module if needed).
2. Validate required query params and return Subsonic-compatible errors via `subsonicError`.
3. Return response payloads through `subsonicOk` using existing mapper helpers where possible.
4. Register the router in `backend/src/routes/subsonic/index.ts` (preserve catch-all behavior).
5. Update the endpoint support list in this README and run diagnostics on touched Subsonic route files.
